              Lying on your back, you awaken to the sound of sea water rushing about your ears. Barely conscious, you
              open your eyes slowly to see a glaring sky above.

              As you stagger to your feet and brush the sand from your sunburned face, you notice a colony of crabs
              skittering this way and that at the shoreline. Behind you to the west, an impassable rock face, one
              hundred feet or more high, towers along the length of the beach.

              To the south a old man appears to be fishing. To the north the beach curves out of view.

              The beach where you awoke stretches out before you, jagged cliffs tower along its length. A few crabs
              scuttle and wash around in the sea foam.

              With a wiggling toe, you patiently bait the crabs. Just as one is about to chop it off with its big
              claw, you toss the net over it and then stuff it in your bag. Gotcha!

              You walk northwards along the base of the cliff. The occasional seagull glides along the shore line
              searching for fish in the shallow water. Eventually, you arrive at the edge of a cove.

              To the west, where the cove is most secluded, a steep path disappears up into the cliffside.

              The words "The Dancer" are scrawled across the rear in peeling red paint. The sand is churned up where
