          You sit up, coughing and spluttering, salt water streaming from your nose. The tattered remains of your clothing
          are drenched.

          Lying on your back, you awaken to the sound of sea water rushing about your ears. Barely conscious, you slowly
          open your eyes and see a glaring sky above. Ouch! Something just nipped your toe! What do you do?

          The beach where you awoke stretches out before you, jagged cliffs tower along its length. A few crabs scuttle
          and wash around in the sea foam. To the south a old man appears to be fishing. To the north the beach curves
          out of view.

          They're scuttling around your feet. They look hungry. And tasty.

          With a wiggling toe, you patiently bait the crabs. Just as one is about to chop it off with its big
          claw, you toss the net over it and then stuff it in your bag. Gotcha!

            As you stagger to your feet and brush the sand from your sunburned face, you notice a bunch of small crabs
            skittering this way at the shoreline. Behind you to the west, an impassable rock face, one hundred feet
            or more high, towers along the length of the beach.

          A small blue rowing boat sits on the sand. To the west, where the cove is most secluded, a steep path
          disappears up into the cliffside.

          The words "The Dancer" are scrawled across the rear in peeling red paint. The sand is churned up where you
          pulled the net out.

          Eventually, you arrive at the edge of the cove where a small boat sits on the sand. A steep path disappears
          up into the cliffside to the west.
